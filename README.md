This project contains different queueing models implemetation and analysis:
We have explored 4 Queueing Models namely;
1. M/M/n
2. M/D/n
3. M/L/n 
4. M/M/n with shortest Job first priority
   for different number of servers and explored the way mean waiting time changes as system load changes from 0 - 1.
